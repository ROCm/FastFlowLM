## 🚀 Quick Start

A packaged FLM Windows installer is available here: [**flm-setup.exe**](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM/releases/latest/download/flm-setup.exe). For more details, see the [release notes](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM/releases/).

📺 [**Watch the quick start video (Windows)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYOfDNkyBII)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ⚠️ Ensure NPU driver version is **>= 32.0.203.304** (`.304` is the minimum requirement but `.311` is recommended; check via Task Manager→Performance→NPU or Device Manager).  
> ⚙️ **Tip:**
>   * **RECOMMENDED**: Try running **Windows Update** or **[Driver Download](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**.
>   * **[Official AMD Install Doc](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/inst.html#install-npu-drivers)** *(AMD account required)*.
>   * **[Unofficial forum downloads](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/drivers-amd-npu-ryzen-8xxx-9xxx-apu.24220/)** *(CAUTION, we do not hold responsible for what you download here)*.

After installation, open **PowerShell** (`Win + X → I`). To run a model in terminal (**CLI Mode**):
```powershell
flm run llama3.2:1b
```
> **Notes:**
> - Internet access to HuggingFace is required to download the optimized model kernels.
> - Sometimes downloads from HuggingFace may get corrupted. If this happens, run `flm pull <model_tag> --force` (e.g. `flm pull llama3.2:1b --force`) to re-download and fix them.
> - By default, models are stored in:
>   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\flm\models\`
>   - **Linux**: `~/.config/flm/`
> - During installation on Windows, you can select a different base folder (e.g., if you choose `C:\Users\<USER>\flm`, models will be saved under `C:\Users\<USER>\flm\models\`).
> - On Linux, you can override the default location by setting the `FLM_MODEL_PATH` environment variable.
> - ⚠️ If HuggingFace is not accessible in your region, manually download the model ([check this issue](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM/issues/2)) and place it in the chosen directory.   

🎉🚀 FastFlowLM (FLM) is ready — your NPU is unlocked and you can start chatting with models right away!

Open **Task Manager** (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`). Go to the **Performance** tab → click **NPU** to monitor usage.  

> **⚡ Quick Tips:**  
> - Use `/verbose` during a session to turn on performance reporting (toggle off with `/verbose` again).   
> - Type `/bye` to exit a conversation.  
> - Run `flm list` in PowerShell to show all available models.  

To start the local server (**Server Mode**):
```powershell
flm serve llama3.2:1b
```
> The model tag (e.g., `llama3.2:1b`) sets the initial model, which is optional. If another model is requested, FastFlowLM will automatically switch to it. Local server is on port 52625 (default).

## 🛠️ Building from Source

For developers who want to build FastFlowLM from source, we provide CMake presets for a convenient and consistent build experience.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- CMake (version 3.22 or higher)
- A C++20 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Ninja (recommended)

### Build Instructions

More details on the exact procedure, with dependencies to be installed, for linux can be found in [linux-getting-started.md](docs/linux-getting-started.md).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM.git
    cd FastFlowLM/src
    ```

2.  **Configure CMake using presets:**

    -   **For Linux:**

        ```bash
        cmake --preset linux-default
        ```

        This will configure the build to install to `/opt/fastflowlm`.

    -   **For Windows (in a developer command prompt):**

        ```bash
        cmake --preset windows-default
        ```

3.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    ```

4.  **Install the project (optional):**

    -   **For Linux:**

        ```bash
        sudo cmake --install build
        ```

    -   **For Windows (with administrator privileges):**

        ```bash
        cmake --install build
        ```
