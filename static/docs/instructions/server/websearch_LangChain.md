# 🔍 RAG with Live Web Search + FastFlowLM Summarizer

This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that:
- Performs live web search using `ddgs` (DuckDuckGo)
- Summarizes the results using a local LLM via **FastFlowLM**
- Runs fully offline except for the web search

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Windows machine
- Python 3.9 or later
- [FastFlowLM](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM) installed
- FastFlowLM model served (e.g., `llama3.2:1b`)

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. 🧪 Create the Project Folder

```shell
mkdir rag_websearch_flm
cd rag_websearch_flm
```

### 2. 🐍 Create a Virtual Environment

```shell
python -m venv rag_websearch-env
.\rag_websearch-env\Scripts\activate
```

> 💡 If PowerShell blocks script execution:
```shell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

### 3. 📦 Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -U langchain langchain-community langchainhub langchain-ollama langchain-huggingface sentence-transformers ddgs beautifulsoup4 requests ollama
```

---

### 4. 🚀 Launch FastFlowLM

In another terminal:

```bash
flm serve llama3.2:1b
```

This starts your FastFlowLM API at: `http://localhost:52625`

---

### 5. 📝 Create the Script: `websearch_rag.py`

```python
# websearch_rag.py

## 🧠 What’s Happening Behind the Scenes

This Python script combines real-time web search with a local FastFlowLM model for Research-Augmented Generation (RAG). Here's how each step works:

---

### 🔍 1. Web Search (via DuckDuckGo API)

We use the `ddgs` package to send live search queries to DuckDuckGo. The results include:
- Page titles
- Snippets (summaries)
- URLs

These are printed and also compiled into a large raw text block for downstream use.

---

### 🕸️ 2. Optional: Full Page Scraping

If full-text RAG is enabled, each URL is downloaded via `requests` and parsed using `BeautifulSoup`, skipping:
- `<script>`, `<style>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.

This step pulls **full paragraphs and sentences**, improving retrieval quality.

---

### 🧩 3. Chunking and Embedding

The retrieved or scraped content is broken into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. Each chunk:
- Is around 1000 characters (with overlap)
- Gets embedded using a sentence transformer model via `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`
- Stored in a `FAISS` vector store for fast similarity search

---

### 🤖 4. RAG Retrieval with FastFlowLM

A local FastFlowLM model is accessed via `OllamaLLM`, pointing to `http://localhost:52625`. We build a LangChain `RetrievalQA` pipeline:
- Queries are matched to relevant chunks from the vector store
- A prompt template supplies those chunks as **context**
- FastFlowLM generates an answer based strictly on that context

---

### 🧠 5. Output

You get:
- ✅ Final answer (streamed or batched)
- 📄 Source snippet (for transparency)
- 🔗 Search links (for traceability)

---

### ⚙️ Tools Behind the Curtain

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ddgs` | Live DuckDuckGo search |
| `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` | Scrape full HTML page |
| `langchain.text_splitter` | Chunk large documents |
| `langchain_huggingface` | Create vector embeddings |
| `langchain_community.vectorstores.FAISS` | Store & search context chunks |
| `langchain_ollama.OllamaLLM` | Call local FastFlowLM models |
| `RetrievalQA` | Combine retriever + LLM in RAG pipeline |
